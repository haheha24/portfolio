# portfolio
This is an ever work in progress of my portfolio website. It's created using create-react-app with Typescript on the client side, and express with Typescript on the server side. Other than that, everything is mostly custom in my attempts to learn to do things on my own. I still use libraries and frameworks when needed.

Things to work on:
  - Refactor into smaller components
    - Contact pages specifically.
  - Work on deepening understanding of testing with Jest and React-testing-library.
  - Add more visual animations and better design
