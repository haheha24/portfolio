## Portfolio
This is my portfolio project, constructed as a single page application website. It's created using create-react-app with Typescript on the client side, and an express server with Typescript as well. This portfolio project is a representation of my current skills thus far in my journey as a developer. However, it is also not a final representation, as I continue to learn and try new things that diversifies my skillset. This is demonstrated through my projects that I post relevent links and images about. 

## Project Status
This portfolio is fully deployed on https://thecreativeage.com.au but will always be touched and improved on. 

#### Tasks currently in progress
- Client Side:
  - Refactor into smaller components
    - Contact pages specifically.
  - Work on deepening understanding of testing with Jest and React-testing-library.
  - Loading spinner or indicator while the contact email is being sent
- Server Side:
  - Create a method of only allowing my front end to communicate to my backend contactEmail route
    - Potentially through access-control-allow-headers from my understanding
  - Stronger typing
